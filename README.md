Fitness Tracking Application

Motivation -
This fitness tracking web application was written in order to practice the skills learned at Tech Elevator bootcamp, mixed with some new framworks that I wanted to learn and continue to develop my skills.

Experience Learned - 
Through this project, I was able to gain a stonger understand of how REST ad external APIs work along with spring boot to bring information from an external database to a front end framework. During the bootcamp I attended, I learned VueJS as a front end framework and I wanted to learn ReactJS. I was able to successfully able to create the front end of this web application using JSX and ReactJS.

The final full stack application through Tech Elevator was completed in a group of four where this project was done by myself to ensure that I fully understood the concepts, debugging processes and to focus and complete a project. 

About this application - 
This fitness tracking application grabs essetial information from an external API called API-Ninjas. It is a searchable api with exercise information such as: 

- name
- difficulty
- weight type 
- muscle group 
- description 

This application also allows the user to track their own workout using similar information given by the api and track and view workouts by date etc. 

In the future - 
In the future, I would like to:

- add a filtering system to the logged workouts
- add a visual calendar represenation to easily see when workout was completed 
- add user functionality: logged in and logged out 
- Add a nutritional section as well as track the calories and food information for each day
- Tie project with recent knowledge of working with AWS to host project into the cloud
